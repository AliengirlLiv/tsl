<p>Last Thursday, Congress passed an emergency bill ordering immediate quarantine of the entire southwestern United States, encompassing the entire state of California. After the fifth deployment of troops into the infection zone were quickly infected, the Joint Chiefs of Staff urged the government to withdraw, citing zombies' "uncanny degree of coordination," and "inhuman appetites for brains."</p>

<p>Many have condemned this as a political power play to disrupt the balance of electoral college votes.  Senator Norant (AL), however, insists the move was purely practical. "These zombies have been systematically targeting high-population areas. The Pasadena area is almost entirely undead, and we just lost communiation with Los Angeles. Not one of us enjoys having to abandon part of our nation, but God help us all if they get out into the wider population."</p>

<p>Within hours of this shocking news, administrations across the Claremont Colleges announced varied and ambitious plans to prepare the Colleges for the impending arrival of the zombie horde.  These new proposals were met with a mixture of approval of the administration's decisive response to the news and concern over the hasty nature of these decisions.</p>

<p>"Committees across the Colleges have been quietly designing the new proposed initiatives for weeks," said Mae Landers, president of Pomona College, speaking to a gathering of concerned students in the SCC. "Now that it is plain that no help is coming, we will have to defend ourselves."</p>

<p>Harvey Mudd has announced a controversial new robotics program which will replace the clinic program for Juniors and Seniors. The new program will focus on designing a swarm of combat robots to defend the college's outer borders and possibly venture into the wider community to seek out and eliminate wandering undead. Students and faculty alike at the other Claremont Colleges have voiced concerns about the effectiveness of the program, but Mudders are confident they're up to the task. "I made an underwater robot in STEMs last year that went up and down," said a current Junior. "How different could this be?"</p>

<p>Scripps is taking the lead in investigating ways to sustain a clean water source for the Colleges. While the city's water system is still functioning, urban development specialist Professor Bernstein from Scripps predicts that it it could easily fail within the month.</p>

<p>Pomona and Pitzer have launched a joint initiative to scale their college gardens into sustainable food sources capable of feeding the colleges. In addition, Pitzer immediately cancelled all classes in order to allow students more time to prepare for the upcoming situation. Several Harvey Mudd students protested this decision, complaining in an open letter to the president that discontinuing all Pitzer classes would make it near-impossible for them to complete their humanities requirements. The Pitzer student body, on the other hand,  almost universally supports this measure.</p>

<p>Unlike the other Claremont Colleges, CMC did not announce its new anti-zombie initiative for a full 24 hours after the announcement of the quarantine. Just yesterday, an anonymous leak from within the administration revealed the reason: CMC's initial proposed contribution to the anti-zombie initiative would have been for CMC to take an official leadership role among the colleges and to coordinate the distribution of resources to various colleges during the college. Pomona administration firmly rejected the initiative, forcing CMC to scramble to develop an alternative proposal. Despite its rushed formulation, the opening of the new biochemistry lab has been praised throughout the colleges. It is not yet known exactly how the zombie infection is transmitted, but the lab intends to obtain fluid samples of zombie blood in order to determine how these creatures manage to live indefinitely and subsist off brains. "We have next-generation equipment capable analyzing the  of these creatures down to the molecular level," boasted Professor Natalia Bata, who will lead the new lab. "If the zombies arrive we'll be ready."</p>

<p>The question of "if" the zombies will arrive should now truly be "when." With Caltech overrun and L.A. now infected, it will be a race against time to see if the colleges will be prepared before the horde arrives.
